      <p>Open to 15-18 year olds (S5-6/Highers/Advanced Highers students), these 3 day workshops will introduce
        university-level study and practice in our disciplines, and encourage students to think beyond their school work
        and to explore new ideas. Held in the Pathfoot Building on the beautiful University of Stirling campus, the cost
        (£85) covers space, tuition and access to any necessary equipment: students should bring their own lunch and
        snacks, or can buy food and drink at the campus cafes/supermarket. This is not a residential course, though
        accommodation can be booked separately at the Stirling Court Hotel/student residences if desired. Places are
        limited and early enrolment is encouraged. </p>
      <div> </div>
      <p><u>Timings</u>: Wednesday 7 August, 11am-4pm. Thursday 8 August, 10-4pm. Friday 9 August, 11-4pm. Please note
        there will be an end of course showcase on the Friday, which parents and carers are welcome to attend, and we
        may offer an optional 4-6pm activity (e.g. a film showing) for some workshops on Thursday. </p>
